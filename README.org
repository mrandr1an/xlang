/Everything underlined in bold is supposed to be a rust object inside the xlang codebase./

Everything starts with an input /I/ where the user either with the /CLI(A), TUI(B)/ or even directly from the /STDIN(C)/ inputs a String of characters
into the xlang *_InputBuffer_*. This buffer holds a mutable reference of that String which is supposedly the source code that the user wants evaluated
in an /E/ way.

#+begin_src rust
  struct InputBuffer<'a>{
   value: &'a mut String
  }
#+end_src

Depending on /E/ the code must be evaluated differently so the idea is to abstract
